My name's Abdulrahman Saeed Elshafie, I'm a passionate software engineer with experience with *Python* and *Flutter*. 

I've used python for a couple of projects in implementing Web Automations using Selenium and AI projects using *Tensorflow* and *Sklearn*. Have some experience with different famous packages such as *Numpy*, *Pandas*, *PySimpleGUI*, and some specialized packages for specific purposes and APIs such as *pyairtable*, *dropbox*, *googlesearch*.

I built some automations using python, I've one project on automating the process of creating job description using *Selenium* and *PySimpleGUI*. Used PySimpleGUI to take some info about the company from the user and Selenium to open *Poe.com* to use ChatGPT for this task for **FREE** and with no issues because of the bot detection recapcha and saving the descriptions into a CSV file. 

Another project was about getting the ranking of a company using *googlesearch*, it takes the name of your company, and the focus keywords your rank in, then start looking for your position. 

I've many AI and Data Science projects, one of them was EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis) on STEG dataset. The objective of this project was to fraud detection for users who steels electricity and gas from the company, first I went through a detailed steps in processing the data and analysing it to using calcification models. This project features dealing with *unbalanced data*, *data processing*, *testing different AI models* from *Sklearn* and *Tensorflow*.
